Sheep for Android
=================

Author: Dan Ruscoe (dan@ruscoe.org).

This is my Android tribute to an old Windows screen saver named Sheep vs Gravity. First released in 1997, you can still download the screen saver here:

Like the screen saver, the game features sheep which jump exponentially higher until they fall from a height that will destroy them.

In the game, the player attempts to save the sheep using an accelerometer-controlled bounce pad.

This is a recording I made of a MIDI rendition of a part of Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture. The musical piece is in the public domain and this recording should be considered the same.
